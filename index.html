<h1 class="p1" id="rcorners1"> The End Goal </h1>
<p class="p2" id="rcorners4"> Hello, my name is Wayne Landon Hearns II, and this is my art exhibit, called End Goal. This art exhibit shows art pieces from professional video game concept artists. The main reason that I chose this for my topic is to continue to push young artists to reach “the end goal” (hence the name of the exhibition).  

Artists all around the world have reached their desired goal; their highest part of their career. Working with a team, working with great artists and teams to make great and legendary games that people see and play around the world end up here. And young artists who come to the gallery get the sense and reminder of what their end goal is and what they are striving to achieve. Artist tend to lead different paths in there career, whether it’s to learn different trades that will boost their knowledge and flexibility or they work hard towards a specific field to master there craft; Either way, all artist have an end goal to where they feel accomplished and have a portfolio filled of great designs. Whether it be with a team or personal projects that were created alone, everything from learning experience to everything that entered that portfolio consequently boosted your reputation and lead to further huge projects. 

Being in the creative field is not an easy task but we do this to bring creativity and life onto the world and redesign aspects that give us joy in our image. Life without imagination and creativity is a life that is scarce of happiness. What I hope people will take away from this exhibit and keep with them once they leave is that everyone in the industry that has made something of their career, all started at the beginning and kept climbing until they reached their desired goal. It's not about where you start but if you have the determination to keep going until you reach your end goal.</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

<B> Words From Artist:</B> "I was commissioned by the amazing YT creator SmoughTown to create a couple of renders to compliment their new Elden Ring lore video about the Gloam-Eyed Queen and the Godskins.
This temple is a sacred place where the new Godskin Apostles are born. Forged in the black flames of death and cradled by the Gloam-Eyed Queen herself, the newly born Apostles will grow to become the death of the gods
The altar depicts the many stages of Godskin Garb preparation as a symbolic welcoming of the newborn apostle into the world."" <br>
